Rather than help the prehistoric king of the jungle run faster, its legs allowed for a steady and continuous pace to be maintained.</p><p>“The assumption tends to be that animals with adaptations for running, such as long legs, are adapted for a higher maximum speed, but this paper shows that there’s more to running than speed,” said Holtz, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whose paper was published in the PLOS ONE journal</a>.</p><p>“When you’re a bigger animal, those adaptations may also be for endurance and efficiency. It may be about being a marathoner rather than a sprinter.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279764 alt="Illustration Of The Differences Between Theropods" width=900 height=540 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/illustration-of-the-differences-between-theropods.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279764 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>T. Holtz/University of Maryland</span><span class=caption-body>Long limbs allowed smaller theropods to run faster, while the larger dinosaurs used their long legs to conserve energy in order to stalk prey for longer periods of time.</span></p><p>The resourceful researchers used a variety of metrics to reach this conclusion. Limb proportion, size ratio, body mass, and gait size were all incorporated to garner estimates of the top speeds of over 70 species of dinosaur called theropods.</p><p>In terms of size, the groups’ spectrum ranged from dinosaurs weighing half a pound to more than nine tons. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to IFL Science</a>, the group is characterized by three-toed limbs and hollow bones. The T. rex wasn’t the only bipedal predator included in the study, but was a significant focus.</p><p>Since the success of the T. rex — which virtually ruled the world for 180 million years — has often been attributed to running speed, Holtz and his team were eager to clarify matters.</p><p>To give an idea of the massive size these creatures reached, the average T. rex’s legs were about 11 feet long. Sue, the largest T. rex on record, had a stride that likely measured between 12 and 15 feet.</p><p>However, the new research showed that while longer legs were in some cases associated with higher top speeds, that rule only applied to small and medium-size theropods. Dinosaurs weighing over 2,200 pounds were found to be no faster than their shorter counterparts, though they certainly moved more efficiently.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279773 alt="Skull And Skeleton Of Tyrannosaurus Rex" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/skull-and-skeleton-of-tyrannosaurus-rex.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279773 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><span class=caption-body>The study incorporated the limb proportions, size ratios, body masses, and gait sizes of 70 different theropods to reach its conclusions.</span></p><p>Holtz and his colleagues assessed just how much energy each of the 70 theropods needed to move at a walking speed. This helped them calculate that the larger types, which longer legs, didn’t need as much energy to amble about.</p><p>“That’s actually a very beneficial savings, because predators tend to spend a great deal of their time foraging, searching for prey,” said Holtz. “If you are burning less fuel during the foraging part of the day, that’s an energy savings that dinosaurs with shorter leg forms didn’t get.”</p><p>Ultimately, the study should help broaden the conversation regarding body proportion and size when it comes to running ability and speed. Often overlooked, those two factors appear to play a major role — with this research countering the notion that long limbs directly correlate to constant running.</p><p>After learning about the study that found T. Rex legs evolved to be long for energy conservation rather than running purposes, <a href=#>meet the “reaper of death” — Tyrannosaurus rex’s older cousin discovered in Canada</a>.
