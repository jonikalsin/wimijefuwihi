While this was not an easy decision, we know it’s the best choice for both of us. We have been through many highs and lows in our 24 years of marriage and as we navigate this new chapter in our lives, we will co-parent our amazing children,” Kim and Barry Plath recently told PEOPLE.</p><p>In a preview for the June 28th episode, Barry said, “One thing I thought wouldn’t ever be shaken was us. Now it’s totally shaken up. It’s just really sad. It’s a tragedy.” Sharing her side of the relationship, Kim shared: “I just feel like I’ve been hurt too much.”</p><p>Hints about their divorce started to occur as soon as Welcome to Plathville came back for its 4th season. In the teaser clip of Welcome To Plathville Episode 1, viewers saw Barry explain that Kim has not been much happy in their relationship because she thinks she’s being taken for granted.</p><p>Barry even explained why Kim was feeling that way about their relationship. “Looking back on my relationship I think I just missed lots of opportunities to show Kim I love her. Like we were taking time to go out, go on a date, that was a concept that I couldn’t put action to, but for Kim, it was an issue.”</p><p>Talking about Kim and Barry’s marriage, the two exchanged the wedding knots in July 1997. According to Distractify, both of them are Christian Fundamentalists and originally met each other at a church.</p><p>Barry and Kim Plath got married in July 1997, according to Us Weekly, and went on to welcome ten children. Tragically, their son, Joshua, died in 2008 in an accident when he was 15 months old.</p><p>The two were friendly initially and there was not anything romantic between them until the voice of God informed Kim Barry was her man. “On the exact same day, before either of us ever talked about it or showed any interest in the other, God revealed to Barry and me that we were going to marry,” Kim wrote in a post on the family’s website.</p><p>In their 24 years of relationship, the duo gave birth to 10 kids–Ethan, Hosanna, Micah, Moriah, Lydia, Isaac, Amber, Cassia, Mercy, and Joshua Plath. However, Barry and Kim Plath faced the worst nightmare when their 17-months-old Joshua died.</p><p>Joshua was killed when Kim was using a car to move fruit trees on the family farm. She lost sight of her baby and accidentally ran over him. After that incident, Kim claimed she sank into depression and credited Barry for pulling her out of it.</p><p>As it seems, Kim’s marriage to Barry was her only marriage.
