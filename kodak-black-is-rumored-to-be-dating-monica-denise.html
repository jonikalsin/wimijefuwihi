<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kodak Black Is Rumored To Be Dating Monica Denise</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Kodak Black</strong>, 25, and Monica Denise, 42, have been trending on social media after dating speculations about the two appeared online. Denise just shared a collection of photos on her Instagram story. She wrote in one of the stories:</p><p>“On a date, I’m a little anxious.”</p><p>The following report, three hours later, had a photo of her with Kodak, raising the possibility that her “date night” had been with him. According to Parle magazine, Kodak Black also posted the same photograph. Netizens have interpreted this as proof that the two are dating. It is crucial to note, however, that neither Monica nor Kodak have made any public remarks regarding the situation.</p><h2>Who is Monica Denise?</h2><p>Monica Denise is 42 years old and was born on October 24, 1980. When she was 11 years old, she landed a record contract with Rowdy Records. Miss Thang, her first album, was released in July 1995. The album’s hits were well appreciated, and it reached the top of the Billboard charts.&nbsp;She subsequently signed with Arista Records and achieved success with her song, For You I Will. She later worked with singer Brandy and recorded a duet titled The Boy Is Mine. For 13 weeks, the song sat at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 list.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Monica-Denise.jpg alt="Monica Denise" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Boy Is Mine, Monica’s second album, was released in July 1998 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2000. This album holds the record for the singer’s best-selling album of all time.&nbsp;All Eyez on Me, her third album, was released in September 2002. After the Storm, her fourth studio album was released in June 2003. Denise released her second album, The Makings of Me, in 2006. It debuted at number one on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums list. Still Standing, her next album, was released in 2010.</p><p>Monica Denise made her feature film debut in 2000 with Love Song, followed by Felicity and American Dreams. She also appeared in the film ATL as a cameo. Aside from it, she appeared in the reality program Monica: The Single in 2008. In 2011, she also appeared in the first season of the reality program The Voice.</p><p>Monica’s seventh album, New Life, was released in April 2012 to mixed reviews from fans and reviewers. Despite this, it remained at the top of the Billboard 200. Her seventh studio album, Code Red, garnered a similar reaction. Trenches, her eighth studio album, was released in December 2018.&nbsp;Monica Denise released her first song, Commitment, in January 2019, followed by Me + You in April 2019. She also starred in the seventh season of T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, and her most recent song, Friends, was released in July of this year.</p><h2>Why do many believe Kodak Black and Monica Denise are in a relationship?</h2><p>Dating speculations between the two initially surfaced approximately a week ago, when Kodak was seen accompanying Monica in her recent TikTok video, in which they danced to Black’s new single, Spin.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kodak-Black-1.jpg alt="Kodak Black" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another video involving the two became popular as well. Get You by Daniel Caesar is sung by Black and Denise in the video. The video, shot in a vehicle, shows Monica in the backseat as Kodak drives and records her while the two of them sing and grin at the camera. As previously said, despite reports of the two datings, neither Kodak nor Monica has publicly acknowledged the claims.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiiqJyRoHqjuMCcomaho2K%2FtrnOq5ydZaSkeqOxjJ2YraGenHquu82imppllJq7qr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-blake-3.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Blake Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
