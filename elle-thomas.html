She’s been in the profession for over seven years and has over 1,700 hours of on-air experience as a live anchor. Before going to Utah, Elle was the single anchor and producer of a morning and noon show.</p><h2><span id=Childhood>Childhood</span></h2><p>Elle is from Salt Lake City, Utah, and was born in the 1990s. She is an avid traveler who is currently striving to visit the New Seven Wonders of the World — she just has two more to go! Elle earned a Bachelor of Science in broadcast journalism from Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications. While living in Arizona, she worked as a “one-man-band” reporter for KAET and wrote for a variety of print and online publications.</p><h2><span id=The_Career_of_Elle_Thomas>The Career of Elle Thomas</span></h2><p>Elle has seven years of journalism experience and is currently a freelance on-air journalist for CNBC’s The News with Sheppard Smith. She recently completed three years in Salt Lake City, Utah. During her time in the beehive state, Elle had the distinction of telling over 700 stories. She also stepped in as needed and could fill eight positions across the station. Elle was a regular on the anchor desk, reporting, assisting with production, managing, and writing for the web, and she was trained on the WSI Max Weather/Traffic system to design and deliver traffic graphics. She also hosted, produced, and wrote for The PLACE, a daily, hour-long lifestyle show on the channel. She was the interim morning executive producer and mentored several morning program producers.</p><p>Elle was also the morning newsroom manager at the time, in charge of writing and fact-checking copy, maintaining the station’s social media pages, answering phones, replying to viewer emails, and coordinating station operations with the sales team. Elle had perfected the art of multitasking… as well as high-heeled jogging. When personnel was limited, Elle stepped in as morning/afternoon floor director, repositioning studio cameras and getting guests mic’d up during commercial breaks before returning to the desk for the next block. Elle is presently looking for work in the top 30 broadcast markets and networks as an anchor, reporter, host, and traffic reporter.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Elle is currently in a relationship with a man called Wyatt Conner, as evidenced by the frequent appearance of photos of him in her Instagram account. During the quarantine period, the couple spent some quality time together in Seattle, and she shared some photos of it. Though she prefers to keep her relationship status secret, she does not reveal much about her personal life to the general world.</p><h2><span id=Elle_Thomas_Salary_and_Earnings>Elle Thomas Salary and Earnings</span></h2><p>She has an estimated Net worth of $1 million, which she has amassed via her work as an anchor as a result of her dedication and hard work.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Elle Thomas estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
