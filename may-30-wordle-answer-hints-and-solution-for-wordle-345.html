With each word you put in, the game will give you back letters in grey, yellow, or green boxes.</p><p>An optimal way to start your first guess is to use a word with at least 3 or more vowels. Most 5 letter words, aside from an extremely rare few, will contain a vowel. Once you rule out all the vowels by your second guess, you should also be careful not to repeat already used grey letters. The same applies to repeating other letters.</p><p>Ideally, you want to eliminate as many letters as possible so you know what to work with. If you are at your 4th try or later, then repeating letters won’t be a bad idea. That only applies if you ruled out a majority of the letters by the time you got to that attempt.</p><p>You can play <strong>Wordle</strong> for free via the New York Times’ website. <a href=# rel=noopener>If you want to check out other Wordle alternatives, check out our hand-picked list.</a></p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZqaZqWKAcXnWqKmdpJVirq%2B%2F1p6pZqCZo8G0ecCnm2arn6HCtbXOp2Sfp6JixLC%2Bw6WcZmtkanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./169776-lauren-london-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren London Celebrates Son's 3rd Birthday after Eric Holder Was Indicted for Nipsey Hussle Murder</span></a>
