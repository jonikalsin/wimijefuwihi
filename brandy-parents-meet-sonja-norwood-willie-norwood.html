Several honors and prizes, such as a Grammy and an American Music Award, have been bestowed upon her for her work.</p><h2>Who are Brandy’s parents?</h2><p>She was born to Sonja Norwood (mother) and&nbsp; Willie Norwood (father).</p><p>Norwood’s vocal range is contralto. Both Norwood and music critics have frequently described her voice as husky, raspy, and gentle. The voice tone of Norwood is “an odd mix of warmth and cold, steely edges,” according to music critic and Slant Magazine writer Andrew Chan.</p><p>He goes on to further characterize her voice, noting, “Brandy’s deft use of tone and texture rewards careful attention unlike few other pop singers.</p><p>Long, cascading riffs, which many R&B purists adore her for, have always been her primary claim to technical prowess.” Norwood is renowned for her skill in layering and constructing complex vocal arrangements using multitrack recording.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kr7OtzZ2wZqiRp7KvwNJmpJ6dpGLAsLrJmmSnp6KsvLCwjLCgpaSZmnqvu9GwpqicXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mummified-ice-age-cave-bear.html><span>←</span><span>Prehistoric Cave Bear Found In Siberia With Internal Organs Intact</span></a>
