Sometimes, when nothing appears, some people start a rumor or misunderstand an event that causes a buzz on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>In Young MA’s case, there have been rumors of her getting pregnant. However, because of her controversial character and, to an extent, her sexual orientation, many found it hard to believe.&nbsp;</p><p>So is Young MA pregnant? Keep reading to find out.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Young_MA></span>Who Is Young MA?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Young MA is a talented rapper who has been making waves in the hip-hop industry since she went viral in 2016 with her hit single “Ooouuu.”&nbsp;She was born Katorah Marrero in Brooklyn, New York, in 1992, and her journey to fame is commendable. She developed an affinity for music at a young age, having been inspired by stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and DMX.&nbsp;</p><p>Young MA would spend hours putting rhymes together and recording music in her bedroom, but after she released “Ooouuu,” her life changed, and she became a bonafide hip-hop star. The track, which went viral, garnered millions of views on YouTube and won her many fans.&nbsp;</p><p>It had a catchy hook, and the rapper’s confident, sophisticated verses identified her as a rising star in the rap game. Since that first hit, Young MA has not let up on her fans. She has given them chart-topping hits and collaborated with some of the biggest names in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The talented woman has been praised for her raw, honest lyrics and unique rap flow, which set her apart from other female rappers in her league. Right now, the world is waiting for more projects from her but in the meantime, what about her alleged pregnancy?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Young_MA_Pregnant></span>Is Young MA Pregnant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Young MA is not pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>Late in 2022, rumors that she was with a child started spreading across the internet, and it got her fans confused as they wondered if it could be true.&nbsp;The story began circulating on November 2, 2022, but that was all.&nbsp;</p><p>A quick scan through her active Instagram page showed that the rapper was <a href=#>not pregnant</a>. A post at the time revealed she was off on a road trip with her girlfriend, Kaylah Gooden.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13.png><p>This was not enough to shut down the rumors; not long after, speculations on who the father might be started spreading.&nbsp;Young MA, known to keep up with the goings-on on social media, refused to acknowledge or respond to the rumor, which fueled it even more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Young_MA_Pregnant_By></span>Who Is Young MA Pregnant By?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Young MA is not currently pregnant, and she has never gotten pregnant. As such, the question of who the father of her child is has no answer.&nbsp;</p><p>When the rumors were still hot, her fans balked at the possibility of the rapper carrying a baby. Not only did her character not make that likely, but she is also gay. This means there may be no pregnancy.</p><p>Also, if the pregnancy rumor were ever true, her girlfriend Gooden would be a more likely candidate.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rumors_Young_MA_Rapper_Is_Pregnant_Also_Surfaced_in_2021></span>Rumors Young MA Rapper Is Pregnant Also Surfaced in 2021<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 2022 rumor of her being pregnant is not Young MA’s first time getting suspected of being with a child. In July 2021, rumors that she was pregnant <a href=#>started circulating</a> after a clip from an interview she did in 2019 with radio personality Headkrack surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>“Absolutely,” Young M.A. told Headkrack when asked if she sees herself as a parent.&nbsp;</p><p>She also said: “Yeah, I’ll be married by then. … I want a boy. … I want a boy first and then a girl. That’s it. I don’t wanna OD. The set is complete. I’d rather a boy first.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/k.jpg><p>When the rumor reached a crescendo in 2021, Young MA took to social media to set the records straight. She did this by commenting under the post to clarify that she was not pregnant.</p><p>She wrote: “Of course, my girl is the one that’s going to be pregnant. That’s why I looked at her and mentioned her smh. … Y’all bored, lol, but I get it. … Sell ya stories [smirk emoji], and we workin’ on one now.”</p><p>Social media does many things well, including spreading pregnancy rumors about stars. Over the years, people like <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, Megan Thee Stallion, and others have been subjected to rumors like this.&nbsp;</p><p>They are rarely true, as in Young MA’s case, but they always appear now and again with celebrities.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR52Kisp59doq5uvNGenqeZnql6tbTEZqmaqKCav260wKxknZ2RocFuw8itn2aoopq0r63NnLBmqqWivLO%2FjJucn6eimnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mistakenly-declared-dead.html><span>←</span><span>9 Times People Were Presumed Dead And Then Found Alive</span></a>
