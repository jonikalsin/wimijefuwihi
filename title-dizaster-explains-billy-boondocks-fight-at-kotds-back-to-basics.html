I couldn’t hold him into position that’s why I—the reason why I ended up punching his face out on the floor is because he punched me. And that pissed me off. It really did. He cocked me with a right and it pissed me the fuck off. That’s why I slammed him on the wall, fucking slammed him on the ground and punched his face out. He started leaking. I had blood on my fucking knuckles. After I punched him and he was doing all this shit, he wasn’t doing none of that, I just stopped hitting him. It looks like someone pulled me off but I let them pull me off. It was kind of like that Math shit because when I was on top of Math he wasn’t fighting bro. He was just curled up and trying to grab on shirt and shit like that. So I just stopped at one point because you’re just not gonna keep hitting somebody that’s not hitting you back bro.”</p>Please enable Javascript to watch this video<p>AD LOADING...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjaIJzgo6toK2klWOxqsbArKueql2axbG4wKKlrGWSnrmtxYybpqimlKSwrL%2BMn6CgoKRirrV5yqirnatdl66kt4ytpmaakai2pL8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlize-therons-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Charlize Therons Height, Weight And Body Measurements</span></a>
