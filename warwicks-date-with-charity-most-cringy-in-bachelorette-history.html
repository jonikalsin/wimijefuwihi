Keep reading to find out more.</p><h3>Does Warwick and&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;Charity Lawson’s date deserve the most cringy award?</h3><p>Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile spoke on&nbsp;Bachelor Happy Hour&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;Charity Lawson’s cringy date with Warwick Reider. During the one-on-one date, Warwick was having a hard time staying awake. Most men would have adrenaline pumping and ready to impress their lady. Not Warwick.</p><p>The two were dressed up nicely with him in a tux and her in a fancy gown. They went to an amusement park and got to ride all the rides. However, no matter what they tried, there seemed to be more awkwardness than actual good conversation.</p><p>In the end, Warwick never made it back to the mansion. Charity sent him home on their date after realizing there really is no chemistry between them.</p><p>Joe Amabile weighed in on the awkward date. He said, “It was a rough, rough one-on-one date. If we’re awkwardly silent on this podcast right now, that’s because that’s how the date was. And I’m an awkward person, but I watched that, and I was like, ‘This is awkward.’ I would say it’s TV, so you never know how awkward it really was.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Charity-Lawson-via-YouTube-5.jpg></p><p>Serena thinks the date was even more awkward than fans saw on television. She said based on Charity’s interviews the date was really uncomfortable. It seems this date may really take the top spot for most cringy.</p><p>In the end, they just weren’t meant for one another and Joe is glad they were at least on the same page about him heading home.</p><h3>Warwick kept falling asleep</h3><p>Even after&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;sent Warwick home, he was having a hard time staying awake to talk to producers. Everyone knew that Warwick understood that things would never have worked between him and Charity.</p><p>Serena said, “I liked that too. At least he owns who he is, but there was no chemistry. He’s a beautiful-looking man and they would’ve made a gorgeous couple, but there was just nothing between them. I also couldn’t believe that they made them wear black tie to the carnival. I would’ve been so mad walking around in a gown and heels.”</p><p>Serena and Joe also talked about Warwick making an appearance on&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;and both agreed he would not be a good fit. In fact, they are curious how he ended up on the show at all. He had shared with Charity that he was a little bit hesitant to be in a relationship.&nbsp;Did anyone explain to Warwick what this show is?</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Charity-and-Warwick-via-Insta.jpg></p><p>Charity obviously made the right decision in letting Warwick go while on their date. Why drag on something that will never work?</p><p>What did you think about their date? Is it the most cringy in&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;history?</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates and spoilers.</p><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f1b5671b1ae7d4cfaeeeca732654db88?s=500&r=g2x" height=250 width=250 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Jamie is a Nurse and a mom of boys whose true passion is writing.
