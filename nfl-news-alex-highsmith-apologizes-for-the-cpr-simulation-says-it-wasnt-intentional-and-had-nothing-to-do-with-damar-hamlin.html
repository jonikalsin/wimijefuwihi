Alex Highsmith was unaware of the social media bashing he was receiving until he reached the locker room after the Steelers’ 28-14 win over the Browns. He made it abundantly clear that the celebration had nothing to do with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Damar Hamlin</a>.</p><p>“I just don’t want people to think of me that way and think I was doing anything [intentional],” Highsmith said via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pittsburgh Post Gazette</a>. “Because I would never, ever, ever, ever want to do that intentionally, and I never ever would do that.” Alex Highsmith has had a breakout season this year as he finishes with 14.5 sacks and 5 forced fumbles. The Steelers’ defense is going to be a formidable one with the current Highsmith and T.J. Watt.</p><p>Pittsburgh has nominated the 25-year-old linebacker for the <strong>Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award</strong>. This award is given by the NFL to the player “who best demonstrates the qualities of on-field sportsmanship, including fair play, respect for the game and opponents, and integrity in competition.” Highsmith defended himself, saying that he has nothing but love for Damar Hamlin.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“When that happened, I was shook for a couple days. Me and my wife, we were watching the game, we immediately saw it and intentionally started praying, intentionally prayed for him, his parents, the doctors, the nurses,” Highsmith added. He further said that he is thankful for God saving Hamlin’s life and reiterated that the ‘CPR simulation’ was not intentional and wasn’t planned at all.</p><p><strong>Do follow us on:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Ever thought of having him killed,” TB to Steve Harvey MOCKING every prominent NFL player for losing to the invincible Tom Brady in 2019</a></p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I blame Kyler Murray for Kliff Kingsbury being fired,” Emmanuel Acho says it was Murray’s abysmal performance that got the Cardinals’ HC fired</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBurcuer2agmZy1tLnIrZ9mmaCkubCzyLOcrGWWpL9uwMeeZJyoomLAqrnUpZitoZ%2BjerSt2KxkoqxdrK60utNmoKeslaPBqrvNmqNmmZ6Zeqmtw2alqKyYnruoedOoZJ2nXay2tbSMnZimmaJitaK5y6KlaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stranger-things-season-3-gaten-matarazzo-rare-bone-disorder-dustin.html><span>←</span><span>'Stranger Things' star Gaten Matarazzo's rare bone condition is the defining factor of his character</span></a>
