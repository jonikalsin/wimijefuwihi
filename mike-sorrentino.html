They dated each other from 2004 to 2007. The couple exclusively&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>revealed their engagement </strong></a>in April 2018, after Mike popped the question while&nbsp;<i>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</i>&nbsp;cameras rolled.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lavish and Beautiful Wedding Ceremony</h2><p>For the weddings, Sorrentino wore a black suit and a matching bow tie, and his bride wore a fitted white and lace gown with a veil.
