His second broken heart tattoo is on the back of his right hand along with the bible verse Romans 12:21 “do not be overcome by evil,” his birth year “96,” and “No Rulez” for the No Rulez Recording Studio where he recorded his parts of his debut album Total Xanarchy.</p><p>The couple went to the tattoo parlor together.
