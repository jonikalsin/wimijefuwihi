To calm him after the loss of his friends, he was injected with a substance that would make him forget. Eventually, Mewtwo was mature and fully grown. He sensed the scientists outside of his tube and shattered it to take his first breath. The scientists were thrilled at Mewtwo's existence; however, they did not see Mewtwo as a living being worth respect, but only as the end result of their experiment. Because he had lost its compassion, he destroyed them for their ignorance and was discovered among the burning wreck of the lab by Giovanni, who took him back to <a href=# title="Viridian City">Viridian City</a> to use.</p><p>Eventually, after discovering that Giovanni, too, saw him only as a tool, Mewtwo escaped, destroying Team Rocket's facility near <a href=# title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a> and the metal suit that restricted his powers.

After seeing <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s sacrifice to stop the fighting, though, Mewtwo changed his mind and sent the Trainers home, abandoning New Island once more.
