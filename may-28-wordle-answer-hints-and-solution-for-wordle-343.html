You aren’t given any hints at the beginning. You simply have to enter a word and the game will give you back hints based on the letters of the words. For example:</p><img title="May 28 Wordle Answer: Hints and Solution for Wordle 343" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wordle-Example.jpg alt=Wordle-Example width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In this game I played a while back, I used the word POWER as my opener. Every letter except the P was not going to be in the word of the day. From there, I tried another word, SCALP. I got the letter S in the right spot, but the P is still not in the right position.</p><p>I try the word SPINY this time. Now I got the P and the letter N to be green! With only two more letters, I made sure I didn’t repeat any that I had previously used.</p><p>With my luck, I submitted the word SPUNK and I got the word correct. My strategy was to build off of the clues given to me from subsequent tries. Of course, my opener wasn’t as optimal as something like using a word like AUDIO or ADIEU. The more vowels you rule out from the beginning, the better chance you have at guaranteeing a yellow or green letter.</p><p>You can play Wordle for free via the New York Times’ website. <a href=# rel=noopener>If you want to check out other Wordle alternatives, check out our hand-picked list.</a></p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZqaZqWJ%2FeXnWqKmdpJVirq%2B%2F1p6pZqCZo8G0ecCnm2arn6HCtbXOp2Sfp6JixLC%2Bw6WcZmtkaHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-zeller-obituary-oak-park-illinois-an-oprf-alum-has-sadly-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Zeller Obituary, Oak Park Illinois, An OPRF Alum Has Sadly Passed Away</span></a>
