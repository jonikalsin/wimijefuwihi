Jesse was born on the 25th September 1982 in Riverton, New Jersey USA, and has used the popularity of the channel PrankvsPrank to increase his net worth.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jesse Wellens is, as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, Jesse Wellens has acquired a total wealth of $5 million, primarily thanks to his successful YouTube channel, but also through other ventures, such as film production.</p><h3>PrankvsPrank Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Before starting the channel, Jesse and Jeana dated for four years; their first video was the cinnamon challenge, and after getting attention for this particular video, it sparked a series of similar videos, which only encouraged the two to continue with their work. Gradually the two became more popular, and with such videos as “Girlfriend Fake Head in Bed Scare Prank”, which now has more than 17 million views, and “How to scare you Girlfriend with a fake Spider”, which has around 2 million views, only cemented their place in the YouTube community. Several years after the inception of the channel, USA Today rated the two as YouTube’s best pranksters, while in 2015, they received the Streamy Award for the Best Prank Show, and the following year won the Shorty Award for the Best YouTube Ensemble. Unfortunately, the two broke up in 2016, and since then, Jesse is the only admin of the channel and it is renamed to Jesse. He now has more than 10 million subscribers, and has garnered close to two billion views, increasing his net worth to a large degree.</p><p>Encouraged by their early success, Jesse and Jeana started another channel BFvsGF, which was more of a vlog channel. However, soon enough the number of their subscribers began rising steadily, and at the present they have more than 9.3 million subscribers, while the videos on this channel have been viewed more than 2.8 billion times, which has significantly increased Jesse and Jeana’s wealth. Jeana is now the owner of this channel, and has continued uploading videos despite their breakup.</p><p>Aside from PrankvsPrank, Jesse is also a producer of short films, based out of Venice Beach, California, which has also increased Jesse’s net worth, though he has also resided in New York City since his breakup from Jeana.</p><p>Regarding Jesse’s personal life, he has been single since breaking up with Jeana, and is apparently focused entirely on building his solo career.</p><p>Before meeting Jeana, Jesse was married and divorced and decided he doesn’t want to marry again. His mother, Stella, committed suicide in December 2015, after years suffering from depression.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.732451678535><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 25, 1982</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Riverton, New Jersey USA</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>YouTube personality, prankster, comedian, vlogger, film producer, game commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Partner</td><td>Jennifer "Jeana" Smith (2005-2016)</td></tr><tr readability=0.34782608695652><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/PrankvsPrank/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/Jessewelle</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34615384615385><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/jessewelle/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5646557/</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Streamy Award - Best Prank Show (2015), Shorty Award - Best YouTube Ensemble (2016)</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>BFvsGF (YouTube channel)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>BlackBoxTV Pranks (2013), Cookie Dance (2013), Escape the Night (2016), Badbadnotgood: Lavender ft.
