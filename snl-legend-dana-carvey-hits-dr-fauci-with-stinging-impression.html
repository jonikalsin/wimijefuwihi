The two poked fun at Fauci’s COVID-19 guidance throughout the years of the coronavirus pandemic, with Carvey giving his best impression of Fauci trying to convince Americans to take a daily COVID shot that grants immunity for up to 39 seconds.
Carvey’s bit of satire had Spade and the rest of the podcast’s production crew laughing out loud on set."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
