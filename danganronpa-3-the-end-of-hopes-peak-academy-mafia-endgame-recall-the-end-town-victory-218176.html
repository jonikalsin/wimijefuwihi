"Was it all a dream?", he wondered. Maybe the mutual killing game was just a terrible fantasy he dreamt out of fear. It looked like he was inside his Gundam, the GAT-X303 Aegis, which he used to fight in many of his battles and against the Despair. It was a powerful weapon, and with Kira Yamato, they'd make an indestructible pair that foiled many of the Despair's plans.</i></p><p>He booted up his GAT-X303 only to find himself in a room of what looked like to be some kind of hard metal, most likely to not prevent him from leaving. "So I am still trapped after all, but why put me in this suit? Wouldn't it be harder to kill me that way?", he wondered, but then noticed from afar that there was another Gundam in the room. Athrun decided to go look at it closer out of curiosity, only to be shocked by the sight he saw.</p><p>The Gundam in front of him was the GAT-X105, which was Kira's Gundam. "What's Kira's Gundam doing here...!? No... don't tell me they captured him!", thought Athrun in shock. Suddenly, the GAT-X105 was being turned on, and then charged towards Athrun's Gundam. Athrun jumped off to evade the attacker's assault, and then drew out his Gundam's sword for melee combat. The GAT-X105 did the same, and then jumped towards Athrun to slash him, only to miss again thanks to Athrun's quick reflexes and impressive Gundam piloting skills. He wasn't called the Ultimate Gundam Pilot for nothing. Athrun tried calling out to the Gundam using the cockpit's communication device, but got no response.</p><p>"That can't be Kira in the Gundam trying to kill me! We're very dear to each other, there's no way the Despair would have made him kill me! This must be a trick!". With Athrun's newfound resolve to not fall for the Despair's tricks, he used his Sword Strike to damage the Gundam, and then impaled it with the opening he made. He removed the sword and saw blood on it. Athrun started panicking, as it must have meant that a person really was inside.</p><p>The cockpit of the GAT-X105 opened, and it came out Kira, his body stabbed, bleeding. Athrun immediately ejected himself from the cockpit and went near Kira while calling out his name.</p><p>"KIRA...!"</p><p>No response came.</p><p>Athrun killed his most dear person and he had to accept that fact.</p><p>The fact that Despair tricked him by drugging Kira and then remote controlling Kira's Gundam to fight against Athrun.</p><p>Athrun cried and went into such a bad state of mind that he couldn't even think. The Despair themselves wanted him to fall into Despair killing such an important person in their lives. A person they saved countless times, only to now kill them. He felt so stupid. He couldn't live with himself, the Despair found his one weak point and abused it by using it against him. Athrun's reason for living, his Hope in this cruel world filled with Despair was now gone.</p><p>Athrun went back into his own Gundam's cockpit and started his GAT-X303. He drew out the bloody sword that he killed Kira with, and used it to stab himself.<br><span><span class=button-text><span>Spoiler</span></span> You are <b>Athrun Zala</b> <span class=button-text><span>Spoiler</span></span> <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXomwmH5.jpg&hash=d1c2c6893357ce3935007cd6cdc3ddf6" data-url=http://i.imgur.com/XomwmH5.jpg data-zoom-target=1 alt=XomwmH5.jpg title width height style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><i>"He was an enemy! He was no longer on my side! I had no choice but to kill him, did I?“</i><p>Son of the prominent PLANT politician Patrick Zala and an ace pilot of the ZAFT forces, Athrun is a Coordinator – a genetically enhanced human – who fights for Rau le Creuset's mobile suit team. He is a quiet and reserved pilot who wishes for justice, but he struggles with indecisiveness in determining who or what he should truly be fighting for and at times gets lost in simply following the orders of his superiors, hoping that doing so will eventually lead him in the right direction.</p><p>Due to the events of the Bloody Valentine incident, Athrun lost his mother while humanity began to fight amongst itself as Naturals – using the power of the Earth Alliance – instigated attacks against Coordinators and their home on the PLANTs, leading to war between those the two groups. After the Creuset team steals the prototype Gundams from Heliopolis, Athrun pilots the GAT-X303 Aegis and comes into conflict with his childhood friend, Kira Yamato. Athrun struggles to understand why Kira - a fellow Coordinator - sides with the Naturals rather than the Coordinators and ends up fighting him multiple times. Eventually, one of his teammates dies while trying to protect him, breaking Athrun's already-uncertain resolve to fight for ZAFT even further.</p><p>As the war goes on, Athrun realizes that the leadership of the PLANTs under his father is corrupt and genocidal, leading him to abandon his team and home in order to help Kira in his fight for peace among humanity.</p><p>You are the <b>Ultimate Gundam Pilot. </b>Your skills in using the GAT-X303 have earned you this title as it has made you victorious in many battles beating many enemy Gundam.</p><p><b><u>Forbidden Action:</u></b></p><p><b>Saying your Forbidden Action. Even saying "I can't tell my Forbidden Action/Something is preventing me from sharing it", counts as saying it. Saying "I am not telling you because I don't want to." is acceptable.</b></p><p>You are allied with <b>Hope. </b>You win once <b>Despair </b>has been defeated.</p></span>​</p><p>Game Trivia: FinalArcadia was the only player to submit a description of her character along with an image.
